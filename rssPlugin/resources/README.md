# Resources

This directory should only contain the two images that BuildFire requires for our plugin. Do not add any other project dependencies to this directory; they will not be available to the plugin.

- `image.png` (400x400): Hero image shown to app owners who install the plugin into their Plugin Manager.
- `icon.png` (200x200): Icon shown to plugin users in the emulator and "on the actual device". (Unsure what that quoted bit means; it's from the BuildFire docs.)
